bit - 0 or 1
byte - 8 bits(A,1)
KB - 1024 bytes 
MB - 1024 KBs
GB - 1024 MBs
Tb - 1024 GBs

Computer disk storage holds primary data - HDD | SSD
->Non volatile 
->Contains os and user files 
->size ranges - 256GB , 512 GB, 1TB, 2TB
->SSD(500MB/s to 3500 Mb/s) are more expensive and faster than HDD(80 MB/s to 160 MB/s)

RAM(Random Access Memory)- primary data storage 
->holds data structures , variables, application data
->Allows for quick read/write access 
-> volatile memory 
-> 4GB, 8GB, 16GB(personal comp) -> 32GB, 64GB (high end server)
-> spped - >5000 MB/s

Cache - smaller than RAM typically in MBs but faster than Ram (nanosec in L1 cache)
CPU - first checks the L1 cache-> L2 cache -> L3 cache -> RAM
store freq used data here to optimize cpu performance

3 par of system design -> Moving Data | Storing Data | Tranforming Data

What makes a good design -> Scalability , Maintainability, Efficiency, Reliability(planning for failure)

CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - > consistency, availability , partition tolerance 
consistency - if one node is changed the changes must be reflected in all nodes in the distributed sys 
availabilty - system is always operational and open to req (measured in percentages)
partition tolerance - sys capabilty to continue func even if their is a network disturbance 

acc to CAP theorem you can only achieve two out of these at one time CA,CP,AP

# Availability #

99.9% availabilty - 8.76 hrs of downtime/year
99.999% availabilty - 5 min of downtime / year 

SLO - Service level obj  - setting goals for our systems performance like 300ms/ 99.9%
SLA - Service level Agreements - define the mini level of service we're committing to provide 

Reliabilty ,fault tolerance and Reduncdancy 

Measures of Speed -> 

-> Throughput - how much data our sys can handle over a certain period of time 
  -> RPS ->  req per sec, server throughput
  -> QPS -> query per sec, db throughout 
  -> byte/s-> data throughtput 

-> Latency -> how long it takes to handle a single request
