Platform to automate developer workflows (including but not limited to CI/CD pipelines)


What are those work flows ?
in open source projects :
-> add new contributors 
-> pull requests are created
-> organizational task   
    -> bug minor/major   
    -> is it reproduceable  
    -> asignee to a contributer  
        -> review pull request  
        ->is the bug fixed?   
        -> merge to master branch  
              -> Prepare release notes   
              -> update version number   

CI/CD pipeline 
-> merged code 
-> test
-> build 
-> deploment 

when something happens in or to you repository -> Events   
example PR Created, Contr. joined , issue created , PR merged  

Automatic actions are executed in response
