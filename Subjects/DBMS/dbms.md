## 1. Database Basics
- ACID Properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Types of Databases (Relational, NoSQL, Columnar, Document, Key-Value)
- Difference Between SQL and NoSQL

---

## 2. SQL Queries & Concepts
- Basic Queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- `GROUP BY` and Aggregate Functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`)
- `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, `DISTINCT`
- Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`, `SELF`)
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`)
- `CASE` Statement and Conditional Logic
- Transactions (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`)

---

## 3. Normalization & Denormalization
- Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Functional Dependencies
- When to Denormalize for Performance

---

## 4. Indexing & Query Optimization
- Types of Indexes (`B-Tree`, `Hash`, `GIN`, `BRIN`)
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for Query Optimization
- Partitioning (Range, List, Hash)
- Sharding and Replication

---

## 5. Stored Procedures, Functions & Triggers
- `CREATE PROCEDURE` vs `CREATE FUNCTION`
- Using Triggers for Auditing & Constraints
- Event-Driven Processing in Databases

---

## 6. Concurrency Control & Isolation Levels
- Locks (`Shared`, `Exclusive`, `Row-level`, `Table-level`)
- Deadlocks and How to Handle Them
- Isolation Levels (`Read Uncommitted`, `Read Committed`, `Repeatable Read`, `Serializable`)

---

## 7. NoSQL Databases
- Types (`Document`, `Key-Value`, `Column`, `Graph`)
- Comparison with SQL Databases
- CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)

---

## 8. Backup & Recovery
- Logical vs Physical Backup
- Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Database Snapshots

---

## 9. Security in Databases
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- `GRANT` and `REVOKE` Commands
- Data Encryption & Masking
